== Description ==

A custom full site editing starter theme created for [Client Name] by Patrick Boehner.


== Development Notes ==

- Do I want to wrap the post pagination in a nav with an aria label
and should it be jus through a filter or a block variation and filter
- Skip links, consider removing and adding own solution
- Site logo, how to handle SVG. Do I want to allow SVG uploads or handle it through an icon block?
